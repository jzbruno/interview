# Interview Code Exercises

## Overview

This repo contains various coding exercises to use during technical interviews. The exercises used will vary depending 
on the position and level being interviewed for.

I have example answers in private repos. Send me a request if you would like to see them.

## FizzBuzz

Used to validate basic coding skills in a specific language. The interviewee should demonstrate understanding of basic 
programming logic and understanding of the basic language syntax without looking it up.

Write a function that given an integer returns:

- Fizz if the integer is a multiple of 3
- Buzz if the integer is a multiple of 5
- FizzBuzz if the integer is a multiple of both 3 and 5
- The integer as string if the integer is not a multiple of 3 or 5

## SumIt

Inspired by https://github.com/kenblair/interview-demo

Used to validate basic coding skills in a specific language. The interviewee should demonstrate understanding of basic 
programming logic and understanding of the basic language syntax without looking it up.

Write a function that returns the sum of all integers between two integers. For example given 3 and 5 the return should 
be 12 or (3 + 4 + 5) = 12.
